##What are the names and NetIDs of all your team members? Who is the captain? The captain will have more administrative duties than team members.
I am the only contributor for this project, my netID is`dmikha2`

##What system have you chosen? What function are you adding? How will the new function benefit the users?
I have chosen to expand the EducationalWeb system. I've chosen to add the ability to compare university courses (or entire degree programs between schools) by extracting key terms from a universities graduation requirements and course syllabi.This allows students to understand whether a concept they're trying to learn is in fact a core/fringe part of their class (as compared to other courses)

For example, unlike UIUC, Rose-Hulman's Multivariate Calculus course doesn't cover certain vector calculus concepts (Green's theorem, etc). They're dropped because of the shorter term (quarter system vs semester), in general this allows for more flexible curricula, majors that require vector calculus knowledge will still get it elsewhere.

Regardless, there are a few questions that could be answeredL: what is the minimal set of key terms that should be covered in order for a course to be called "multivariate calculus"? What other interesting patterns could come up when comparing course syllabi? What are the key terms that a B.S. Computer Scientist from UIUC should know?

##How will you demonstrate that the new function works as expected?
I will demonstrate that the new functionality works by producing histograms to vizualize the word vectors of each syllabus.

##How will your code communicate with or utilize the system?
Unsure at this time, this may just be a standalone package.

##Which programming language do you plan to use?
python

##Please justify that the workload of your topic is at least 20*N hours, N being the total number of students in your team. You may list the main tasks to be completed, and the estimated time cost for each task. 
5 hours - get used to the old system
5 hours - generate sample data 
5 hours - generate keywords for each syllabus and present them
5 hours - presentation and fine tuning
